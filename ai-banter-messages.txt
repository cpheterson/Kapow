AI BANTER MESSAGES - KAPOW! Card Game
======================================

Messages appear in the sidebar below the scorecard in yellow italic text.
They persist until the player takes their next action (draw or card click).


1. OPPONENT DISCARD HELPS AI COMPLETE A TRIAD (discard_helps_ai)
   Trigger: AI completes a triad using a card drawn from the discard pile,
            BUT only when the opponent knowingly provided that card
            (replaced a revealed card, discarded a drawn card, or completed a triad).
            Face-down cards that happen to help the AI do NOT trigger this.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Thanks, I needed that!
   - Thanks for the card. Keep them coming!
   - I owe you one... Just kidding!
   - Much appreciated!
   - Watch what you discard!
   - Did you really mean to give me that?
   - (smirk emojis)
   - I appreciate the charity work.
   - You didn't have to do that, but I'm glad you did.
   - Are you trying to make this too easy for me?
   - Thanks for the assist!
   - Well, that's one way to play it...
   - I didn't need that much help, but I'll take it.
   - Are you playing for me, or against me?
   - I'm planning to win anyway, but thanks for speeding it up.
   - If you keep this up, I might actually have to start trying.
   - Are you sure you read the rules?


2. AI COMPLETES A TRIAD (ai_completes_triad)
   Trigger: AI completes a triad (card was NOT from the discard pile,
            or opponent didn't knowingly provide it).
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - One down!
   - That's how it's done.
   - Boom! Triad complete.
   - Triads don't complete themselves... oh wait, mine do.
   - Another one bites the dust.
   - Piece by piece, I build my empire.
   - That's called strategy.
   - Check that off the list.
   - Like clockwork.
   - And that's how the pros do it.


3. AI GOES OUT (ai_goes_out)
   Trigger: AI reveals all cards and goes out, ending the round.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - And that's a wrap!
   - Game, set, match... well, round.
   - Read it and weep!
   - I'm out! Your turn to sweat.
   - All done here. No pressure.
   - Hope you've got a good last move in you.
   - Dropping the mic.
   - That's all, folks!
   - Out! Good luck on your final turn.


4. PLAYER GOES OUT (player_goes_out)
   Trigger: Human player goes out.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Not bad... Let's see if it pays off.
   - Bold move. I respect it.
   - I hope you did the math on that one.
   - Going out already? Brave.
   - Interesting choice. Let's see how this plays out.
   - You sure about that? No take-backs!
   - Okay, my turn to clean up.
   - Confident! I like it.


5. AI WINS THE ROUND (ai_wins_round)
   Trigger: AI has the lower score at the end of a round
            (and no doubling occurred for either player).
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Better luck next round!
   - I'll try to go easy on you... nah.
   - My round! Want some tips?
   - That's how you close out a round.
   - Another round in the books.
   - Don't worry, there are more rounds to go.
   - I'd say sorry, but I'm not.


6. PLAYER WINS THE ROUND (player_wins_round)
   Trigger: Player has the lower score at the end of a round
            (and no doubling occurred for either player).
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Enjoy it while it lasts.
   - Lucky round. Won't happen again.
   - Okay, you got me. This time.
   - Not bad! But I'm just warming up.
   - Well played... this round.
   - I let you have that one.
   - Savor it. It won't last.


7. PLAYER GETS DOUBLED (player_doubled)
   Trigger: Player goes out first but doesn't have the strictly lowest
            score, so their score is doubled.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Ouch! That's gotta sting.
   - The doubling rule is brutal, isn't it?
   - Double trouble!
   - That's a costly way to go out.
   - Going out first is a gamble, and you lost it.
   - Doubled! That'll leave a mark.
   - Maybe next time, check the scoreboard first?


8. AI GETS DOUBLED (ai_doubled)
   Trigger: AI goes out first but doesn't have the strictly lowest
            score, so its score is doubled.
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Well... that didn't go as planned.
   - I meant to do that. Character building.
   - Okay, I deserved that one.
   - We don't talk about this round.
   - Let's pretend that didn't happen.
   - Even geniuses have off days.
   - That was... a learning experience.


9. AI GRABS KAPOW FROM DISCARD (ai_grabs_kapow)
   Trigger: AI draws a KAPOW! wild card from the discard pile (always fires).
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Don't mind if I do!
   - A wild card? Yes please!
   - KAPOW! Mine now.
   - I'll take that KAPOW, thank you very much.
   - You left a KAPOW on the discard pile?!
   - Christmas came early!
   - A KAPOW! This changes everything.


10. AI TAKES FROM DISCARD (ai_takes_discard)
    Trigger: AI draws any non-KAPOW card from the discard pile
             (fires 30% of the time to avoid being annoying).
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    - I'll take that off your hands.
    - One person's trash...
    - Thanks, this is exactly what I needed.
    - Didn't need that, did you?
    - I see you don't want this. I do.
    - Your loss, my gain.


11. AI WINS THE GAME (ai_wins_game)

    - That was fun! Well, for me anyway.
    - Another win for the AI. Humanity: 0.
